"an the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignatian and dislike men who
are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, 
so blindedby desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to e
equal blame belangs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will,
whis t saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of
choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what
we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in 
certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligatiansof 
business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds thesematters
this principle of selectian: he rejects pleasures to secure  othe
greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
